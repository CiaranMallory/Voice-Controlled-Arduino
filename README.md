# Voice-Controlled-Arduino
I created this program using Googles Text-to-Speech (gTTS) module. This program controls a built-in Arduino Uno LED via voice. To turn on the LED, simply say "Turn on LED" and to turn off LED say "Turn off LED". The program uses the pyserial library to allow communication between the python script and the Arduino.
